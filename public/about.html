<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Vlatka and I'm from Zagreb, Croatia.</p>

<p>Since childhood, my passion has been music and art, but I also have that less creative side that requires a more logical, mathematical, organized and, so to speak, cooler approach to something.</p>

<p>I have great interest in new technologies, therefore web development is something that makes me very happy and that allows me to combine those two sides of me into something beautiful, useful and productive in a very interesting and challenging way.</p>
